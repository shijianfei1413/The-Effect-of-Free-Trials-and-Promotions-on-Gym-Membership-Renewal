# The Effect of Free Trials and Promotions on Gym Membership Renewal

## Overview
This project investigates whether offering free trials and promotional sessions with professional trainers can increase gym membership renewals. The study explores strategies for converting trial members into long-term members and improving overall retention rates.

## Research Questions
1. **14-Month vs. 12-Month Membership Renewal:** Does extending membership renewal to 14 months at the same price as 12 months increase renewal rates?
2. **3 vs. 5 Free Training Sessions:** Does offering 5 free sessions with professional trainers increase renewal rates compared to 3 sessions?
3. **No Free Sessions vs. 3 Free Sessions:** Does offering 3 free sessions with trainers increase renewal rates compared to offering no sessions?

## Methodology
- **Population:** Members of a national gym whose memberships are expiring within the next three months.
- **Sample Size:** 200 participants per group (control and treatment) with a 15% expected increase in renewal rates.
- **Procedure:** Six gym branches were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. Members received promotional offers via email, and renewal rates were tracked and analyzed.

## Key Findings
- Significant increases in renewal rates were detected in groups receiving longer membership periods or more free training sessions.
- Larger sample sizes are recommended to increase the precision of future studies.
